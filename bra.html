                <p>The day you start wearing a bra is the day you choose it to be.  There is no set timeline as everyone's body will develop at a different pace. Often times, girls choose to start wearing bras when they first notice their breast buds beginning to develop and showing through their tops.  The breast tissue is starting to develop!  </p>

                <p>No. The answer is no now and will be no for ever.  Wearing a bra is a choice.  When you're first considering wearing your first bra, you may feel pressure from friends, classmates, or others around to do it as soon as possible. Whether you are starting to develop or not the timing is up to you.  Don't be afraid to ask a parent, counselor, or another adult when you're ready for help on securing your first bra.</p>

                <p>Understanding bra sizes can be confusing at first, but all you have to do is remember two things: the underbust and overbust measurement.  These will convert to your band size and cup size measurements.  For example, while referencing a chart, if your under bust measurement is 28-30 inches, your band size 32 in the USA. (Did we mention that these numbers change around the world?) If over bust measurement is 32-33in, your cup size will be A. You can check out our resource page down below to find a link to a more detailed chart.</p>
