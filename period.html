                <p>Normal is relative! Keep in mind that is difficult to define 'normal' for the entire female population. We all have unique bodies and various factors affecting our menstruation. Signs of irregular heavy bleeding include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>periods lasting longer than 7 days</li>
                    <li>needing to change pads or tampons every 1-2 hours
                    <li>finding clots larger than the size of a quarter</li>
                    <li>and/or feeling fatigued or short of breath. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most women experience a menstrual flow of around 2-3 tablespoons during the average 2 to 7 day period. To give you some perspective, the average amount of blood would fully soak 6 sanitary products. (Keep in mind these are all averages!)</p>

                <p>Ask any person who bleeds on the monthly if they ever panicked because they were not prepared for a visit from Aunt Flow, and they will likely have at least one story in mind. Most of us have been there. While it can definitely cause panic at the time, take a deep breath and consider your options. The best case scenario is you have a friend or colleage that has some spare products or wouldn't mind running to the local CVS. If you're not so lucky and are stuck in an empty bathroom at school or any other unfortunate situation, wadded up toilet paper can hold you over. A word of advice, if you need to use this diy pad, try to find an actual feminine hygiene product as soon as possible since this technique often leads to leakage.</p>

                <p>Pads, tampons, and menstrual cups, oh my! There is an abundance of feminine hygiene products on the market today. It can definitely get overwhelming. It's important to remember that you're just looking for what works for you! It doesn't matter if all your friends use tampons but you have a spoft spot for the classic pad. There is no right or wrong when it comes to use of period products, as long as you're taking care of your body and being safe. So what are the options? Well the most common include the pad, tampon, and menstrual cup. Pads are typically seen as the most beginner friendly. Just take one out of the package, stick it to your underwear (they may have wings that wrap around your underwear too) and voila. You're set. Tampons, on the other hand, may seem intimidating. These are inserted into the vagina to soak up the blood. Here is a video with instructions on how to insert one! For a more eco-friendl option, you ma want to try the menstrual cup. These are reusable cups that are also inserted in the vagina to collect blood.</p>
                <p>Did you know ... </p>
                <p>"Menstrual pads have been mentioned in history as early as the 10th century in Ancient Greece, where a woman is said to have thrown one of her used menstrual rags at an admirer in an attempt to get rid of him."</p>

                <p>We may be sound like a broken record but normal is relative! The color of your period blood may range from a dark brown to vibrant red. Also, don't freak out if you see some clumps! You may experience some differences in textures like clots and tissue during different periods (no pun intended) of your cycle. However, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor if you experience heavy clotting or your period blood changes in color (not red, brown, or black). </p>

                <p>The legendary hymen. Legend has it that this "piece of tissue" that is draped across vaginas tears when a woman first has sex, signifying her loss of virginity. Let's deconstruct this! It ma be a surprise to you, but the hymen does not cover the entire vagina. The hymen in thin, fleshy tissue that surrounds the opening of your vagina. Some girls are born with a small amount of tissue and others are born without one. There are cases where the hymen entirely covers the opening, however this is extremely rare. Usually, hymens have a large enough hole for period blood to flow through and for you to use tampons without pain. The reason many think that vaginal sex "breaks" a hymen is because it can be stretched open by this. However, there are many ways your hymen can be stretched, for instance horsebackriding or playing sports. The idea that you lose your v-card when your hymen is stretched ("broken") is clearly false. Long story short, yes a tampon cany stretch your hymen. However, this is not very common and you can start with lighter tampons are these are usually smaller in width! As far as the virginity is concerned, you can still be a virgin and enjoy the benefits of tampons. </p>
