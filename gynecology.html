                        <p>Come as you are! If you shave regularly then do your thing, if you don't that works too. Whatever you do to maintain your female hygiene, keep doing it, no need to change any of it before you go.
                    
                        Instead you should prepare by reviewing your medical history (past surgeries, medicines, family history, etc.) and gathering all the concerns and questions you'd like to address.  If you're having a hard time thinking of questions, check out the section 'What questions should I ask?' below.</p>

                            <p>There is no specific age when it comes to scheduling your first appointment. Instead, you can schedule your appointment when you need help. We have a few examples below of what needing help could look like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>if you have become sexually active</li>
                                <li>if you are having menstrual problems such as a lot pain, excessive bleeding, or no periods at all</li>
                                <li>abnormal discharge</li>
                                <li>skin problems</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Make sure to ask when you should schedule your next appointment.</p>

                        <p>Your provider will need to collect as much information as it takes to give you the best advice, so what your first exam will consist of will heavily depend upon the purpose of your visit.  Some exams may include a pelvic exam and a breast examination, and others may only be a conversation.</p>

                    <p>Let your provider know if you are concerned about pain.  Your first visit may or may not include a speculum exam depending on the nature of your visit.  The speculum is the about the width of a penis or vibrator and is inserted so the doctor can get a better look at the inside of the vagina. If you've already engaged in sexual activity, there should be no pain associated with the speculum exam.  If you haven't and/or are still concerned about the pain, your doctor may use a pediatric speculum, a physical exam to feel the internal organs with gloved fingers, or a sonogram depending upon the situation.</p>
