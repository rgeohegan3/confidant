                    My story wasn't really dramatic or anything.  When I was in 7th or 8th grade. I remember my older cousin taking me and my younger sister out to eat at a Golden Corral.  My stomach was feeling off so I started out with my vegetables.  My cousin thought it was weird a kid would walk straight past the dessert and get some broccoli.  Anyway, when I got home went used the restroom, I realized I'd gotten my period.  Luckily my mom was at home and she had some supplies on hand. After the whole experience, I faintly recalled reading a children's book about seeing a small dot in my undies every month. I remember thinking that was a whole lie.</p>

                    Oof. I try not to remember middle school...but I guess we're ripping off the banding and opening up this conversation. I remember one day after gym class, I was changing clothes in the bathroom and looked down to see some odd brown/red colored substance on my underwear. You know those movie moments where everything zooms out and the person loses focus? Yeah, it felt exactly like that. I'm not sure why but my immediate reaction was terror. After a solid minute of staring, I calmed myself down, got changed and went to the school nurse. Several of my friends had already started their periods and I have an older sister so I was well-versed in menstruation. I knew what it was but I wouldn't say I was happy about it. The worst part was I remember catching my mom writing an email to my aunt and some other family friends about how I had started my period and she was incredibly sad that "her baby was growing up and becoming a woman". I was mortified at the time but I'm actually very grateful that I've open and supportive women in my life, especially when it comes to talking about stigmatized women's health topics.</p>
