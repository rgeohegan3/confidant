                    My story wasn't really dramatic or anything.  When I was in 7th or 8th grade. I remember my older cousin taking me and my younger sister out to eat at a Golden Corral.  My stomach was feeling off so I started out with my vegetables.  My cousin thought it was weird a kid would walk straight past the dessert and get some broccoli.  Anyway, when I got home went used the restroom, I realized I'd gotten my period.  Luckily my mom was at home and she had some supplies on hand. After the whole experience, I faintly recalled reading a children's book about seeing a small dot in my undies every month. I remember thinking that was a whole lie.</p>
